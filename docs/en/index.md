!!! Tip "Full Disclaimer"
    By no means I claim to be expert on LLM. I just happen to be a modder who enjoys combining both of these topics. In case if you have more information, feel free to make a Pull Request to this repository, and we can update this.

## About this Guide

### Why I'm Creating This Guide

I am creating this guide to help modders learn how to use large language models (LLMs) to mod their favorite games. LLMs are a type of artificial intelligence that can be used to generate text, translate languages, and answer questions in a comprehensive and informative way. They have the potential to revolutionize game modding by allowing modders to create new and innovative gameplay experiences.

This guide will not be about LLMs in general. Instead, it will provide the basics of how to write your own mods that utilize LLMs in their core. I am not a machine learning scientist, my knowledge on this is barely scientific, so I will focus on the practical aspects of modding, such as how to choose the right LLM for your project, how to integrate it into your mod, and how to troubleshoot common problems you can encounter.

I believe that LLMs have the potential to enrich modding scene by making LLMs accessible to modders of all skill levels, I hope to encourage more people to create and share their own mods. This will lead to a more diverse and innovative modding scene, and ultimately create a better gaming experience for everyone.

Here are some specific examples of how LLMs can be used to mod games:

* Generate new dialogue for NPCs
* Create new quests and storylines
* Develop new AI behaviors for enemies and other characters
* Create procedurally generated content, such as maps and dungeons
* Translate games into new languages

However, we will focus on generating dialogues in this guide mostly. That being said, LLMs have a great future ahead and examples mentioned above can very much be implemented as well.

I believe that LLMs have the potential to revolutionize game modding. By making it possible for modders to create new and innovative gameplay experiences for players that increase the replayability of the mods with unique experiences.

I hope that this guide will be a valuable resource for modders who are interested in using LLMs to create new and exciting mods for their favorite games.

### Structure

I will divide this into 3 sections.

* [LLM Modding 101](/101) : Will give overall introduction and required things
* [LLM Modding 201](/201) : Will focus on explaining different LLM types and will focus on their pros ad cons.
* [LLM Modding 301](/301) : Will explain architecture types, give detailed information about known LLM types and some reasoning behind all.
* [LLM Modding 401](/401) : Will focus mostly on using Inworld and discuss it's pros-cons and how-to's
